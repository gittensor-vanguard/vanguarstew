"""Step 3b: make a concrete maintainer decision for a specific request.

Covers the point-in-time calls that have a hard ground truth (merge/request-changes/
reject, triage labels + priority, reviewer, release/bump) and, when implementation is
the right action, a patch. The `rationale` is what the decision-process judge evaluates.
